        <p>Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with
            messages known as "tweets". Registered users can post, like and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can
            only read them. Users access Twitter through its website interface or its mobile-device application software
            ("app"), though the service could also be accessed via SMS before April 2020.[13] Twitter, Inc. is based in
            San Francisco, California, and has more than 25 offices around the world.[14] Tweets were originally
            restricted to 140 characters, but was doubled to 280 for non-CJK languages in November 2017.[15] Audio and
            video tweets remain limited to 140 seconds for most accounts.</p>
