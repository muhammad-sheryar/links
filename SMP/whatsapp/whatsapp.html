        <p>WhatsApp Messenger, or simply WhatsApp, is an American freeware, cross-platform centralized messaging and
            voice-over-IP (VoIP) service owned by Facebook, Inc. It allows users to send text messages and voice
            messages, make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other
            content. WhatsApp's client application runs on mobile devices but is also accessible from desktop
            computers, as long as the user's mobile device remains connected to the Internet while they use the desktop
            app. The service requires each user to provide a standard cellular mobile telephone number for
            registering with the service. In January 2018, WhatsApp released a standalone business app targeted at
            small business owners, called WhatsApp Business, to allow companies to communicate with customers who use
            the standard WhatsApp client.</p>
