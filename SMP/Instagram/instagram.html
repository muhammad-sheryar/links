        <p>Instagram (commonly abbreviated to IG or Insta)[7] is an American photo and video sharing social networking
            service owned by Facebook, created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger and originally launched on iOS in
            October 2010. The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop
            interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. The app
            allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical
            tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content
            by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add their
            content to a feed, a function that seems to be discontinued as of September 2020.</p>
